# Virtual Ethical Hacking Home Lab

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity has become paramount. To stay ahead of potential threats and enhance my skills in ethical hacking, I started a project to create a virtual ethical hacking home lab on my Windows PC. This lab serves as a controlled environment where I can safely explore various hacking techniques, understand system vulnerabilities, and develop defensive strategies without the risk of compromising real-world systems.

The importance of this project in cybersecurity cannot be overstated. As cyber threats continue to grow in sophistication, hands-on experience in a simulated environment is crucial for developing practical skills that translate into real-world scenarios. This lab allows me to practice and refine my ethical hacking skills and provides a platform to understand the implications of different attack vectors and defense mechanisms.

Following a comprehensive guide, I successfully set up a virtual ethical hacking home lab using virtualization software. This setup includes multiple virtual machines, each serving a specific purpose within the lab ecosystem. The lab encompasses both attack and victim machines, allowing me to simulate various cybersecurity scenarios and practice techniques such as network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing.

By creating this lab, I've established a safe and isolated environment to experiment with the latest tools and techniques used in ethical hacking. This practical approach enhances my learning experience and prepares me for potential job roles in cybersecurity and certification exams. Moreover, it demonstrates my skills and commitment to the field, which is invaluable in today's competitive cybersecurity landscape.

## Lab Overview

### Virtualization Software

- **VMware Workstation Pro**

### Virtual Machines

- **Attacker VM:** Kali Linux
- **Victim VM 1:** Windows Server 2016 (Domain Controller)
- **Victim VM 2:** Metasploitable VM with Windows Server 2008

### Network Configuration

Iâ€™ve implemented **Network Address Translation (NAT)** for my virtual network. This configuration provides several benefits:

- **Isolation:** NAT keeps my lab environment separate from my host network, enhancing security.
- **Internet access:** The VMs can access the internet when needed while remaining protected from external connections.
- **Simplified setup:** NAT doesn't require additional network configuration on my host machine.

### Lab Structure

My lab structure allows for various attack scenarios:

- The **Kali Linux VM** is my attack platform, equipped with many penetration testing tools.
- The **Windows Server 2016 Domain Controller** represents a common enterprise target, allowing me to practice Active Directory-based attacks.
- The **Metasploitable VM with Windows Server 2008** provides an intentionally vulnerable system, ideal for exploring older Windows vulnerabilities.

This setup enables me to practice various ethical hacking techniques, from network scanning and enumeration to exploitation and post-exploitation activities, all within a safe, isolated environment.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Lab Topology Design

The network layout consists of three virtual machines connected through a NAT network in VMware Workstation Pro:

- **Attacker VM:** Kali Linux
- **Victim VM 1:** Windows Server 2016 - Domain Controller
- **Victim VM 2:** Metasploitable VM with Windows Server 2008

#### Purpose of Each Machine

- **Kali Linux:** An attack platform equipped with various penetration testing tools.
- **Windows Server 2016:** Acts as a domain controller, simulating a typical enterprise environment target.
- **Metasploitable VM:** Provides an intentionally vulnerable system for practicing exploitation techniques.

### Victim VMs Setup

- **Operating Systems Installed:**
  - Windows Server 2016 (Domain Controller)
  - Windows Server 2008 (Metasploitable VM)
- **Specific Configurations:**
  - Windows Server 2016: Configured as a domain controller to simulate Active Directory-based attacks.
  - Metasploitable VM: Left in its default vulnerable state to provide multiple attack vectors.

### Attack Machine Setup

- **Penetration Testing OS Used:** Kali Linux
- **Key Tools and Software Installed:**

#### Metasploit Framework

1. Installed using the command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install metasploit-framework
   ```
2. Verified the database connection and started the PostgreSQL service:
   ```bash
   sudo msfdb init
   sudo msfdb status
   ```

#### Nmap

1. Installed using the apt package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nmap
   ```
2. Verified the installation:
   ```bash
   nmap --version
   ```

#### Wireshark

1. Installed from the official website.
2. Verified the installation:
   ```bash
   wireshark --version
   ```

#### Burp Suite

- Installed by visiting the official PortSwigger website.

#### Other Tools

- **John the Ripper:** Verified pre-installed and functional.
- **Hydra:** Verified pre-installed and functional.

### Network Configuration

- **Virtual Network Setup:**
  - Used VMware Workstation Pro's built-in NAT networking feature.
  - Configured all VMs to use the same NAT network, allowing inter-VM communication.

- **Segmentation and Isolation:**
  - NAT configuration isolates the host network while allowing internet access when needed.
  - No additional VLANs or network segments were implemented in this basic setup.

## Tools and Technologies

### Virtualization Software

- VMware Workstation Pro: A powerful hosted hypervisor that allows me to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously.

### Operating Systems

- Windows Server 2016 (Domain Controller VM)
- Windows Server 2008 (Metasploitable VM)
- Kali Linux (Attacker VM)

### Security Tools

- **Nmap:** Network scanning and discovery tool
- **Metasploit Framework:** Exploitation and vulnerability testing platform
- **Wireshark:** Network protocol analyzer
- **Aircrack-ng:** Wireless network auditing suite
- **John the Ripper:** Password cracking tool
- **Lynis:** System auditing and vulnerability scanner
- **Nikto:** Web server scanner
- **OpenVAS:** Vulnerability scanner and manager

These tools provide comprehensive capabilities for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and security analysis within my virtual lab environment.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Resource Allocation:**
  - **Challenge:** Initially, I underestimated the resources required to run multiple VMs simultaneously, leading to performance issues and system crashes.
  - **Solution:** Optimized resource allocation for each VM, balancing RAM and CPU usage.

- **Network Connectivity:**
  - **Challenge:** Difficulty establishing proper network connectivity between the VMs.
  - **Solution:** Correctly configured NAT settings in VMware Workstation Pro, ensuring all VMs could communicate while maintaining isolation from the host network.

- **Windows Server Activation:**
  - **Challenge:** Issues activating Windows Server in the VMs due to licensing constraints.
  - **Solution:** Used evaluation versions of Windows Server, which provided full functionality for a limited time, sufficient for lab purposes.

## Conclusion

Building this virtual ethical hacking home lab has enhanced my cybersecurity skills and knowledge. Key takeaways include:

- Hands-on experience with various operating systems and security tools, improving my technical proficiency.
